```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)

data(early_january_weather)
```

Problem 1

The variables in this dataset are `r names(early_january_weather)`.

This dataset has `r ncol(early_january_weather)` variables and `r nrow(early_january_weather)` observations. 

The mean temperature is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`.

Scatterplot
```{r}
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour,y = temp), color = humid) + geom_point()
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf",height = 4, width = 6)
```


Problem 2


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
