## Problem 1

``` r
data(early_january_weather) 
```

The variables in this dataset are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour.

This dataset has 15 variables and 358 observations.

The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_yh3824_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf",height = 4, width = 6)
```

In the scatterplot we can see that temperature rises as the time
increases. We can also see that humidity also seems to increase as the
temperature rises as well.

## Problem 2

``` r
prob2_df=
  tibble(
    num_samp = rnorm (10),
    greater_0 = num_samp > 0,
    char_vec = c("x","y","z","a","b","c","d","e","f","g"),
    fac_vec = factor(c("low","medium","low","high","high","low","low","medium","high","low"))
  )

mean(pull(prob2_df,num_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.2154296

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df,greater_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df,char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df,fac_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

you are unable to take the mean of the character and factor vectors,
only the numeric and logical vectors produced a mean.

``` r
as.numeric(prob2_df$greater_0)
as.numeric(prob2_df$char_vec)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(prob2_df$fac_vec)
```

When you convert the logical, character, and factor variables to numeric
variables, the logical vector becomes all 1s and 0s. The character
vector becomes all NA. And the factor vector reassigns the levels to
1,2,3.

This would explain why when we try to take the mean prior to using
as.numeric, the logical vector is able to produce a mean but the
character and vector are not able to. Even if we do convert it to
numeric, the characters are unable to become numbers and the factor as a
number will not be helpful in finding a mean.
